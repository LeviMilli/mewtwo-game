## How It's Made:


**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Game is based entirely in HTML using canvas. Colission detection and gravity were implemented on x and y axis. Button events were used for controls.



## Optimizations
Add more enemies and custom sounds and music depending on !gameover. Add more levels and more enemies and varying intervals.



## Lessons Learned:

javascript is a really fasinating language and can be used in a multitude of different ways, whether solving coding problems or creating a simple game like this.
